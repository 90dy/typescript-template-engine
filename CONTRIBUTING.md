## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Documentation

- Use Markdown for documentation
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Run tests before submitting a pull request
- Ensure all tests pass

## Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for versioning. The version numbers follow the pattern: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes
